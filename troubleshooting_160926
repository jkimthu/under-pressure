Notes from troubleshooting the pressure control files.
Issue: faster fluctuations terminate before designated max run time


2016 September 26

'test' switching between fluorescein solution and pure water, with 20 sec period

after calibrating and creating signal (twice, SgO and Sg),
RunPressure function was run repeatedly without clearing any variables. Stops appear
in the printout, usually accompanied by skipped timestamps.

Trial 1.
Stops after 3 mins, missing timestamp ~ 160 seconds.

Trial 2.
Stops after 1 min, missing timestamp ~ 40 s.

Trials 3 and 4.
Similar to Trial 2.

Trial 5.
Commented out semi-colon to print lh, no major effect.

Trial 6.
Changed name of signal from SgO to Sg, thinking "signal" variable might not carry well
between functions. Turns out the renaming helped, but only extended run time to 3 mins from 1 min.
In short, refreshed variable helped.

Trial 7.
Commented out pause(60) in while loop, in RunPressure function.
Two switches before stopping, didn't even manage to print a line.

Trial 8.
Shortened pause from 60 seconds to 20 seconds.
Extended run time to 8 mins, but still stopped.

Trial 9.
Shortened pause further to 5 seconds.
