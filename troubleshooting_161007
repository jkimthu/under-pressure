Notes from troubleshooting the pressure control files.
Issue: faster fluctuations terminate before designated max run time

2016 October 07

After troubleshoot sesh 160926, i ran some experiments using my hacked solution:
cut the hard-coded pause() within the runPressure.m script from 60 sec to 5 sec.

However, the first real experiment -- performed at 30 sec -- did not remain stable,
with fluctuations pausing within the first half hour.

This session aims to generate a longer signal, so that MatLab to NI signals don't
have to come as frequently. The coded differences in this run 'test2':

1) the pause() in runPressure.m is back at 60 seconds
2) createSignal.m has been edited, to include concatenate enough full periods
   to span at least 15 mins of time. This concatenated 15+ min signal is the data
   vector used to drive fluctuations.

Differences in output:
1) printed timestamps do not appear per period, rather they appear every vector
   length... so every 15+ mins
2)

Notes:
'test' is a similar test to before, using a single period with pause(5).
